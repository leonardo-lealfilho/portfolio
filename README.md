# Project 2
## [U.S. Accident Forecast per State Time Series](https://github.com/soccershowman/Springboard/blob/master/Capstone_3/README.md)

* Uploaded a dataset with information about individual accidents.
* Selected the necessary columns and made date into datetime data type.
* Transformed each state into columns and counted the daily number of accidents in each one individually.
* Checked the data graphically for potential seasonality and/or trends.
* Acquire orders using AutoArima for the ARIMA model.
* Built individual ARIMA model for each states and saved them as dictionary to make it easier to find them while making each state their own individual model.
* Saved models results as a dataframe and analyzed them graphically.
